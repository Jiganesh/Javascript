// Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.

// Most modern programming languages, like JavaScript, don't start counting at 1 like humans do. 
// They start at 0. This is referred to as Zero-based indexing.

// For example, the character at index 0 in the word Charles is C. So if var firstName = "Charles", 
// you can get the value of the first letter of the string by using firstName[0].

// Example:

// var firstName = "Charles";
// var firstLetter = firstName[0];
// firstLetter would have a value of the string C.


var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0] // Change this line
