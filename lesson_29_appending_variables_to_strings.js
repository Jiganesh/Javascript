// Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals, we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

// Example:

// var anAdjective = "awesome!";
// var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
// ourStr += anAdjective;
// ourStr would have the value freeCodeCamp is awesome!.

var someAdjective = "awesome!";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr+=someAdjective;


// Output will be : Learning to code is awesome!
