// With JavaScript array variables, we can store several pieces of data in one place.

// You start an array declaration with an opening square bracket, end it with a closing square bracket, 
// and put a comma between each entry, like this:

// var sandwich = ["peanut butter", "jelly", "bread"]


var myArray = ["Jiganesh",23,23213412,234.234234,"Patil","234"];
console.log(myArray)
