// Sometimes you will need to build a string, Mad Libs style. 
// By using the concatenation operator (+), you can insert one or more variables into a string you're building.

// Example:

// var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
// var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";
// ourStr would have a value of the string Hello, our name is freeCodeCamp, how are you?.


var myName = "Jiganesh";
var myStr= "My name is "+myName+" and I am well!";

console.log(myStr);
