// Example

// 5 % 2 = 1 because
// Math.floor(5 / 2) = 2 (Quotient)
// 2 * 2 = 4
// 5 - 4 = 1 (Remainder)
// Usage

// In mathematics, a number can be checked to be even or odd by checking the remainder of the division of the number by 2.

// 17 % 2 = 1 (17 is Odd)
// 48 % 2 = 0 (48 is Even)

// Note: The remainder operator is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the modulus operator.
// It is very similar to modulus, but does not work properly with negative numbers.

var remainder=11%3;
console.log(remainder)
