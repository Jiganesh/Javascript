// In JavaScript, String values are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created.

// For example, the following code:

// var myStr = "Bob";
// myStr[0] = "J";
// cannot change the value of myStr to Job, because the contents of myStr cannot be altered. 


// Note that this does not mean that myStr cannot be changed, 
// just that the individual characters of a string literal cannot be changed. 
// The only way to change myStr would be to assign it with a new string, like this:

// var myStr = "Bob";
// myStr = "Job";

// Setup
var myStr = "Jello World";

// Only change code below this line
myStr = "Hello World"; // Change this line
// Only change code above this line
