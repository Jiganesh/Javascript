// You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

// Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

// Example:

// var firstName = "Ada";
// var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
// secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.


var lastName = "Lovelace";
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
